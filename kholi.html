      Virat Kohli Cricket Career When West Delhi Cricket Academy was created in
      1998, Kohli was part of its first batch and received training under
      Rajkumar Sharma. Kohli made his cricket debut in October 2002 with the
      Delhi Under-15 team in the 2002-03 Polly Umrigar Trophy and lead the team
      for the next trophy. He was later selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for
      the 2003-04 Vijay Merchant Trophy where he finished as the highest
      run-scorer
      <br />
      <br />
      At the age of 18, Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil
      Nadu wherein he scored 10 runs. In July 2006, he made his debut in the
      Under-19 team during India's tour of England. India won both ODI and Test
      series. Kohli made his T20 debut next year and emerged as the highest
      run-scorer in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs. The year
      2008 was a life-changing year for Kohli. First, he captained the Under-19
      Cricket World Cup-winning team. Second, he was bought by RCB for $30,000
      on a youth contract for IPL. Third, he made his international debut. After
      recovering from a minor injury, Kohli replaced Gambhir for the tri-series
      in Sri Lanka and batter at no. 4 in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy as
      Yuvraj Singh was recovering from an injury. For the tri-nation ODI
      tournament in Bangladesh in 2010, Tendulkar was rested, thereby enabling
      Kohli to play in each match. Due to his phenomenal performance in
      Bangladesh, he was praised by the then captain MS Dhoni. Kohli was part of
      the World Cup-winning team in 2011 and became the first Indian batsman to
      score a century on World Cup debut. Kohli made his Test debut against West
      Indies at Kingston and performed poorly in the series, amassing just 76
      runs in five innings. In 2015, he became the first Indian batsman to score
      a century against Pakistan in a World Cup match. During South Africa's
      tour of India, he became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000
      runs in T20I cricket, achieving the feat in his 27th innings. During the
      ODI tour of Australia, Kohli emerged as the fastest batsman in the world
      to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, and the fastest to score 25 centuries.
      During the 3 match Test series against Sri Lanka at home in 2017, he
      became the first batsman to score six double hundreds as a captain. That
      year, he scored a total of 2818 international runs, the third-highest by
      an Indian in a calendar year and highest ever by an Indian player. In
      August 2018, he ranked no. 1 in the ICC Test rankings. With this, he
      became the seventh Indian batter to achieve this milestone. He became the
      first Indian, first captain and tenth overall to hit three successive
      centuries in ODIs in October 2018
