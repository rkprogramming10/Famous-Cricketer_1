      Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came
      to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth
      international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team, where he
      quickly established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single
      innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience, Dhoni took over the
      captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led India to the Twenty20 (T20)
      world title. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, among others, moved
      India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings
      for the first time in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with
      the ICC One Day International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009.
      In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in
      front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri
      Lanka in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals
      of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain in
      2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the most for a
      captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired from
      international competition.
